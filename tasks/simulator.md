Execute ArcForges delivery task SIM.01 — Simulation definitions, immutable scenario versions and bounded AST evaluator.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\simulator.md (anchor task-sim-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: service/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Definitions and immutable scenario versions exist; the channel schema (stable ids, value types, units, rate, timestamp semantics) and the V1 generator set (constant, sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, seeded noise, seeded random walk, pulse, step sequence, CSV replay) are defined; the bounded AST (constants, time/tick, channel references, arithmetic, comparison, conditionals, allowlisted numeric functions) validates acyclic dependencies and depth/node-count/per-tick-operation bounds before admission, with no scripting/dynamic compilation/reflection/file access/networking possible.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-51.00 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\51-arcscope-cloud-simulator.md, anchor rule-wp-51.00

Entry condition: ADOPT.07 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] CLOUD.02: the module-boundary pattern the other 20 Cloud modules follow ('Twenty-one module boundaries')
- [contract] CON.21: published SimulationService definition and scenario-version records
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: Cloud:src/Cloud/ArcForges.Cloud.Modules.Scope/Definitions/**; Cloud:src/Cloud/ArcForges.Cloud.Modules.Scope/Ast/**; Cloud:tests/Cloud.Tests.Integration/Scope/Ast/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-cloud-d1-migrations (append): One global D1 migration sequence: each module task authors migrations under its module prefix; the integration owner assigns the global sequence number at merge, regenerates the plan manifest and rejects edits to merged migrations; the migrator applies in sequence with receipts.
Unblocks: SIM.02, SIM.08, SIM.10

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): malformed-AST corpus rejected before any side effect; cyclic-dependency case; each bound exceeded; definition-edit-does-not-affect-existing-runs test; CSV replay with bounded parse report; URL-fetch/host-file-read/cross-workspace-reference each denied — pure in-process unit tests, no D1/R2/host needed yet
Completion evidence for the ledger: AST bounds, cyclic-dependency and sandbox-denial results
Notes: Per producer-artifacts-and-integration.md's WP51 row, this and SIM.02 are exactly the permitted early substitute tier: independent fixed generator vectors, built and proven BEFORE any real D1/R2 integration. The initial simulator execution profile (architecture/23-simulator-and-interchange.md §6, af-sim.v1: generator formulas, RNG spec, AST depth/node/eval limits, duration/batch/concurrency/queue/memory bounds) is already frozen design, not a start edge — implemented directly.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SIM.02 — Deterministic generators, seeded RNG and fault profiles (algorithmic determinism).

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\simulator.md (anchor task-sim-02).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: service/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Same seed and profile produce identical canonical hashes; a changed seed produces different data; every injected fault carries provenance/counters and is exactly positioned; RNG streams are provably independent across channels and fault sources.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-51.01 (the pure-algorithmic half: fixed logical ticks driving canonical data; independently seeded RNG per channel and per fault source; the execution profile pinning numeric/RNG/generator/encoding versions; fault profiles (latency, jitter, drop, duplicate, reorder, disconnect, malformed frame, outlier) at explicit logical boundaries with provenance and counters; same-seed-same-hash and changed-seed-different-data tests; exact fault positions; one channel's RNG not perturbing another's): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\51-arcscope-cloud-simulator.md, anchor rule-wp-51.01

Entry condition: ADOPT.07 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.

- none

Permitted write scope: Cloud:src/Cloud/ArcForges.Cloud.Modules.Scope/Generators/**; Cloud:src/Cloud/ArcForges.Cloud.Modules.Scope/Faults/**; Cloud:tests/Cloud.Tests.Integration/Scope/Generators/**
Unblocks: SIM.03, SIM.08

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): pure in-process determinism tests (hash equality, seed sensitivity, fault-position exactness, RNG-stream independence) — no host/D1/R2 needed for this half
Completion evidence for the ledger: determinism and fault-position results (algorithmic tier)
Notes: WP-51.01's remaining requirement — identical hashes under real-time vs accelerated pacing, and the SimulationPacer state-diagram/wake/retry/cold-start exercise plus 24h pacing/cost recording — needs the real SimulationPacer and is carried as part of SIM.03's obligations/testing instead, since it cannot be exercised before that component exists. See SIM.03.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SIM.03 — Fenced slices and SimulationPacer (DO alarm coordinator, bounded Container segments, D1 checkpoint/fence).

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\simulator.md (anchor task-sim-03).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: service/XL. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Deterministic committed samples and restart recovery pass under real DO alarm delivery, Container execution and D1 checkpoint/fence; the proposed 5s latency is measured and recorded, never claimed as hard real time; every SimulationPacer state-diagram race (duplicate alarm, exhausted retry, sleeping Container, pause/cancel race, duplicate segment, delayed catch-up, accelerated mode) passes.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-51.02 (full: architecture-23 DO alarm integration owner plus bounded Container segments, D1 checkpoint/fence/next_due_at, minutely rescue scan; default 1s and 0.25-10s segment bounds; no permanent hosted-service loop): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\51-arcscope-cloud-simulator.md, anchor rule-wp-51.02
- WP-51.01 (the real-host half: identical hashes under real-time and accelerated pacing; exercise the SimulationPacer state diagram (duplicate/delayed alarm, exhausted automatic retries plus Cron rescue, Container cold start, pause/resume, epoch loss); record 24-hour run cost, alarm/Container/Queue counts and end-to-end pacing distribution against the proposed 5-second target, no hard real-time claim): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\51-arcscope-cloud-simulator.md, anchor rule-wp-51.01

- [artifact] CLOUD.06: published shared atomic families and claims mechanism (lease fencing)
- [artifact] CLOUD.07: published capacity and Container/D1 integration producer mechanism

Permitted write scope: Cloud:src/Cloud/ArcForges.Cloud.BackgroundJobs/SimulationPacer/**; Cloud:tests/Cloud.Tests.Integration/Scope/Pacer/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-cloud-leased-singletons (append): Each publication watermark, Durable Object alarm namespace and R2 prefix has exactly one owning module task; others use its published port; names are reserved in the binding plan before first use.
Unblocks: SIM.04, SIM.07, SIM.08

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): at-least-once alarm, exhausted retry, sleeping Container, pause/cancel race, duplicate segment, delayed catch-up, accelerated mode, and the full slice-recovery Container-kill matrix — this genuinely needs a real (local/dev) Cloud host+D1+Container environment, kept to local/affected-scope per P2-017, not hosted CI
Completion evidence for the ledger: replica contention, fenced takeover, bounded-batch and slice-recovery results; determinism/pacing-equality/fault-position results carried over from WP-51.01's real-host half
Notes: This is the highest-complexity task in the whole area (XL): it is the first place WP51 genuinely needs the real Cloud host, and it deliberately folds in WP-51.01's real-pacing half plus the WP51-level 'Slice recovery acceptance' paragraph, none of which can be honestly tested before SimulationPacer itself exists.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SIM.04 — Canonical publication, checkpoints and recovery.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\simulator.md (anchor task-sim-04).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: service/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Canonical batches are written as immutable objects; manifest entries carry run/profile identity, sequence, logical range, count, encoding, byte length and hash; the manifest row is the commit point with the checkpoint advanced in the same transaction; incomplete objects are invisible and swept; recovery produces byte-identical remaining canonical data across pause/resume, host loss and lease takeover; real Entitlement/Scope/Resource quota is reserved and the current monotonic lease fence is verified in every commit.

Unblocks: SIM.05, SIM.08

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): stale-holder-resumes-after-takeover; cancellation racing segment promotion and quota release; pause/resume producing same remaining data; host loss/takeover producing no duplicate/no missing range; crash-between-object-write-and-manifest-commit leaving a swept invisible object; committed manifest row never referencing an unverified object — real local Cloud host/D1/R2 environment, local/affected-scope per P2-017
Completion evidence for the ledger: recovery equality across pause, host loss and takeover

Execute ArcForges delivery task SIM.05 — Cloud-side simulation.* operations, manifest listing and segment fetch.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\simulator.md (anchor task-sim-05).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: service/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: The eleven simulation.* operations are durable, idempotent and expected-state; a client can list authorised manifests and fetch segments resumably with hash verification; state polling works with realtime disabled.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-51.04 (the Cloud API half: the eleven simulation.* operations as durable, idempotent, expected-state commands; authorised manifest listing; resumable hash-verifiable segment fetch over HTTP or object storage; revision-/cursor-based state polling): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\51-arcscope-cloud-simulator.md, anchor rule-wp-51.04

Unblocks: SIM.06, SIM.08, SIM.09

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): duplicate/stale/out-of-order commands; terminal-run resists resurrection; hash-mismatched segment rejected; reconnect-with-realtime-disabled proves polling is a complete authoritative fallback — real local Cloud host per P2-017

Execute ArcForges delivery task SIM.06 — ArcScope-side simulated DataSource and native ingestion.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\simulator.md (anchor task-sim-06).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: service/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A SimulatedDataSource adapter feeds the ordinary ArcScope acquisition pipeline; simulated data is usable in every normal ArcScope workflow (session, capture, decoder, measurement, report) while remaining labelled synthetic everywhere, including through export/copy; with realtime disabled, a client reaches the same state via the polling fallback.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-51.04 (the ArcScope consumer half: feed retained canonical simulator output through the existing Scope measurement/replay consumer using its recorded profile and configuration; simulation labels remain synthetic, separate from AI origin; recompute statistical/pulse fixtures without changing measurement meaning or treating simulation as hardware evidence; ArcScope's clearly synthetic DataSource feeding the normal acquisition pipeline; seed and profile provenance surviving export and copy; simulated data flowing through session/capture/decoder/measurement/report unchanged; synthetic labelling surviving export): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\51-arcscope-cloud-simulator.md, anchor rule-wp-51.04

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: service/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Deployment policy bounds (channels, rates, duration, AST work, per-workspace/global concurrency, queue/wait time, storage, egress, retention) are enforced before and during execution with capacity reservation; service-entitlement gating is independent of AI credits; term expiry/suspension stops generation at a durable boundary as canceled with reason; a 24-hour bounded-resource soak holds within bounds.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): quota exhaustion before side effects; cross-workspace denial; term expiring mid-run; suspension mid-run; storage exhaustion; retention pass with active readers; partial-cancellation reporting partial; 24-hour bounded-resource soak — real local Cloud host, local/affected-scope per P2-017 (the 24h soak is the one long-running exception explicitly required by this substep)
Completion evidence for the ledger: limit enforcement, entitlement, expiry and 24-hour soak results

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: integration/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Simulator admission and SimulationPacer DO infrastructure work against the real deployed capacity harness, not a local-only simulation

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-21.06 (SimulationPacer real-consumer integration): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\21-cloud-host-and-persistence.md, anchor rule-wp-21.06

Entry condition: ADOPT.07 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] CLOUD.07: real, delivered outcome of CLOUD.07 (Capacity, Container/D1 integration producer and harness)
- [artifact] SIM.01: real, delivered outcome of SIM.01 (Simulation definitions, immutable scenario versions and bounded AST evaluator)
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: 
Unblocks: CLOUD.10

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Local real-integration run of the affected scenario in an existing environment, recorded once; offline and static checks in CI; no hosted runtime, device, browser, live-service or inference CI (P2-017).
Completion evidence for the ledger: Simulator admission and SimulationPacer DO infrastructure work against the real deployed capacity harness, not a local-only simulation
