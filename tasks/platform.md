# ArcForges delivery task prompts — Desktop platform mechanisms

Generated from Design `docs/planning/delivery/delivery-graph.json` by `tools/delivery.py`; do not edit by hand.
Each block is self-contained. Claim a task only when `python tools/delivery.py ready --claims` lists it,
then follow `arcforges-implementation.md`. Tasks are ordered by lane for reading; the order is not a schedule.

## Desktop platform mechanisms

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task PLT.01 — Store abstraction and the single transactional write path.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\platform.md (anchor task-plt-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: IStore/CommitUnit/WriteCommand exist with the eight-step write path (validate, authorize, begin commit unit, apply, journal, advance revision, enqueue outbox, commit, notify) implemented exactly once; persistence types never cross the repository boundary; a policy test proves no alternative write path exists.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-07.00 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\07-local-persistence-foundation.md, anchor rule-wp-07.00
- WP-07:content-origin-carrier-projection-commit Content-origin carrier projection committed atomically with payload in the same owner transaction/journal boundary (SS2 required design input) (package-level obligation contribution): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\07-local-persistence-foundation.md, package-level obligation

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.platform is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] FND.02: CommandId/effect-certainty types
- [artifact] FND.03: Revision type
- [artifact] FND.05: reason-code registry
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Persistence.Sqlite/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-desktopplatform-build-config (append): Solution/project lists, central package versions and CI job lists are appended by the task that adds a project, dependency or job; dependency additions follow the dependency-admission policy with a reviewed receipt; lock files are regenerated after rebase and never hand-merged; the integration owner resolves ordering conflicts at merge.
Unblocks: CLOUD.38, FND.02, NAT.02, NOTES.01, NOTES.02, PLT.05, PLT.07, PLT.08, PLT.39, PLT.43, PLT.44, SCOPE.01, SLATE.10

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit + integration tests against a real local SQLite file (no external service): policy test asserting no alternative write path, concurrency tests for serialised writes/concurrent reads, boundary test that no storage type appears in an application signature. AOT/trim diagnostics build-breaking since this library is IsAotCompatible.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Single-write-path policy test result.
Notes: Interface-first decoupling recommended: define IJournalWriter/IJournalReader here as the seam PLT.02 implements, so PLT.01 and PLT.02 can be authored in parallel PRs against the same interface rather than serially.

Execute ArcForges delivery task PLT.02 — Append-only journal with durability and bounded truncation.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\platform.md (anchor task-plt-02).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: JournalEntry records every commit with enough information to replay; journal writes are durable before a commit is acknowledged; growth is bounded by snapshot policy and truncation is safe under concurrent read.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-07.01 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\07-local-persistence-foundation.md, anchor rule-wp-07.01

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.platform is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] FND.02: CommandId type
- [artifact] FND.03: Revision/Sequence types
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Persistence.Sqlite/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-assistant-store-schema (append): Numbered migrations are allocated at merge by the integration owner (a rebase renumbers pending migrations); each migration is forward-only with its recovery and downgrade-refusal tests; no task edits a merged migration.
Unblocks: NOTES.11, PLT.03, PLT.08, SLATE.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline tests: durability test using a simulated process kill between journal write and commit acknowledgement (in-process fault injection, not a real OS-level crash - that remains local opt-in); replay test; truncation-under-read test.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Durability and replay results.

Execute ArcForges delivery task PLT.03 — Snapshot and crash/corruption recovery.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\platform.md (anchor task-plt-03).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Snapshots are policy-triggered, self-describing and verifiable; recovery selects the latest verifiable snapshot and replays the journal forward to typed outcomes (clean, recovered-with-loss, unrecoverable-with-preserved-evidence); native crash and safe-start paths are handled.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-07.02 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\07-local-persistence-foundation.md, anchor rule-wp-07.02

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.platform is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] PLT.02: journal append/replay implementation
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Persistence.Sqlite/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-desktopplatform-policy-data (append): Generated policy data is regenerated from its pinned source and never hand-edited; the reason-code registry is append-only with stable codes; each task adds its own test classes and evidence rows.
Unblocks: NOTES.11, PLT.08, SLATE.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline tests: full recovery matrix (clean shutdown, hard kill, kill during snapshot, kill during migration, corrupted snapshot, corrupted journal tail, disk-full during write) using simulated fault injection; native-crash/safe-start scenarios beyond process-level simulation are local opt-in only.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Full recovery matrix with a named outcome per case.
Notes: This is one of the two narrowest, highest-value early risk proofs in the whole platform area (with PLT.45 content-helper isolation): if crash recovery has a hidden defect, every downstream product's data-loss guarantees are invalid. Recommend starting this in the same wave as PLT.01/02, not deferred.

Execute ArcForges delivery task PLT.04 — Migration runner.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\platform.md (anchor task-plt-04).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Numbered migrations run through a transactional-per-step, idempotent, resumable-after-interruption runner; StorageSchemaVersion equals the highest applied migration; downgrade is either an explicit reverse migration or a clean refusal.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Persistence.Sqlite/**; DesktopPlatform:fixtures/formats/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-desktopplatform-fixtures (append): Fixtures are added per task in their own directory; golden files are never regenerated to make a test pass.
Unblocks: NOTES.11, PLT.08, PLT.29, SLATE.10, UPD.04

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline tests: forward migration from every historical version fixture, interruption/resume, refusal test for unsupported downgrade, golden-fixture semantic comparison (QI-07).
Completion evidence for the ledger: Migration results against every historical fixture plus semantic comparison.

Execute ArcForges delivery task PLT.05 — Managed resource store (content-addressed blobs).

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\platform.md (anchor task-plt-05).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Content-addressed storage with identity-to-location resolution, integrity verification on read, reference counting derived from a referrer table, and a GC path that never deletes a referenced object even after a crash mid-operation.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-07.04 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\07-local-persistence-foundation.md, anchor rule-wp-07.04

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.platform is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] PLT.01: store abstraction's write-path pattern

Execute ArcForges delivery task PLT.06 — Large append store for high-rate chunked data.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\platform.md (anchor task-plt-06).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A chunked, verifiable append store outside the relational working store, with per-chunk checksums, an explicit end marker, and honest truncation: a crash mid-append yields a verifiable prefix plus a recorded loss, never a silently short file.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/S. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A DerivedStore abstraction with declared rebuild semantics (every derived store deletable/rebuildable from canonical data) and a StoragePressureState model whose eviction policy only ever touches derived data.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-07.06 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\07-local-persistence-foundation.md, anchor rule-wp-07.06

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Generated gRPC over HTTP/2 runs on Windows Named Pipe/Unix domain socket between parent and owned helper/extension children via a custom Kestrel IConnectionListenerFactory and ConnectCallback client, with explicit registration, AOT-safe serialization, and zero local TCP listener.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.platform is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).

Unblocks: NAT.01, PLT.10, PLT.13, PLT.14, PLT.15, PLT.16, PLT.45

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline/local tests against actual OS streams on the build machine (Named Pipe on Windows, UDS on Linux - not hosted-runtime CI, but ordinary process-local sockets the repo's own CI already exercises for native ABI tests): malformed frames, wrong-user denial, assertion of no local TCP listener.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Actual OS streams, malformed frames, wrong-user denial and no local TCP listener.
Notes: This is the WP-level edge most worth re-examining: the old header lists WP08 upstream as '06 and 07'. WP-07 (Persistence) is NOT a real start need for any WP08 substep - WP-04.01's own gate explicitly defers durable command/receipt storage to WP07/21/52, meaning WP08's in-flight idempotency stays memory-only; nothing in WP-08.00-08.06 touches SQLite. Recommend dropping the 07->08 start edge entirely; it appears to be inherited phase-grouping (both are 'Phase A/B foundation') rather than a genuine code dependency.

Notes: The old header lists WP09 upstream as '03, 08'. Reading contracts/02-local-rpc-operations.md closely: product capability ports (ICapabilityProvider etc.) are IN-PROCESS typed calls; only helper/extension children use the WP-08 Named Pipe/UDS transport. WP-09.00-09.06 (identity, registration, selection, availability, context, resources, navigation/health) do not need WP-08 at all. Recommend narrowing the 08->09 edge to apply only where PLT.24 (invocation pipeline) routes to an admitted child - see PLT.24's own start edges.

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): P2-017 CRITICAL NUANCE: static/offline unit and policy tests run in CI, but the actual required evidence - real OS containment (AppContainer/Job Object denial, Landlock/seccomp denial, App-Sandbox/XPC denial, native crash/hang/memory-exhaustion/parent-death cleanup) - is device/OS-level execution that P2-017 explicitly excludes from hosted CI ('no macOS CI; no CI for... desktop GUI... sandbox execution'). This evidence MUST be recorded as local opt-in runs on each supported RID, per the ci-and-local-validation-policy.md and the architecture 24 rule 'a mocked launcher or same-user unrestricted child satisfies this gate: never'.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Real child attempts at product-DB/token reads, outbound TCP/UDP/loopback, sibling-process access, spawn escape, oversized output; OS denial, resource bounds and parent-death cleanup on every supported RID.
Notes: This is the single highest-stakes early risk proof in the desktop platform foundation: PG-22 explicitly states a mocked launcher or unrestricted same-user child cannot close the gate, and the failure mode (hostile parsing escaping containment) would invalidate downstream trust in every product that later touches untrusted content (Notes PDF, Slate media/OTIO, extensions). Recommend prioritising this alongside PLT.03 (persistence recovery). Merged duplicate integration or closure task formerly proposed as CON.96.

Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] PLT.47: emission/dimensions
- [artifact] PLT.48: correlation/causation
- [artifact] PLT.49: redaction
- [artifact] PLT.50: cardinality/sampling
- [artifact] PLT.51: health probes
- [artifact] PLT.52: diagnostics/consent
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:eng/packaging/packages.json
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-desktopplatform-package-inventory (append): Each producer task adds its own package entry; every merge to main packs and publishes all packages at one version; consumers pin the candidate produced by the merge of the capability they need, never waiting for a package closure task; one merge queue.

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): P2-017: offline verify/policy tests; Cloud-side hop evidence deferred per PLT.48's complete edge.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Owned artifact and real-integration receipt per WP-12.90.

Execute ArcForges delivery task PLT.54 — Real hostile-input containment proof with production parser libraries loaded in ContentSandbox.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\platform.md (anchor task-plt-54).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: integration/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: that PG-12/PG-22's OS isolation mechanics (proven against a first-party hostile test parser in PLT.45) hold once real PDFium/FFmpeg/OpenImageIO/OpenColorIO/OTIO composition is loaded into the same helper by WP-13.13 ; this is the point where the SUB-hostile-test-parser substitute is actually replaced.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-11.09 (containment mechanics re-verified against the real parser closure): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\11-security-foundation.md, anchor rule-wp-11.09
- WP-13.13 (production parser composition and its own containment evidence): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\13-high-risk-technical-probes.md, anchor rule-wp-13.13

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.platform is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] PLT.45: real, delivered outcome of PLT.45 (Content helper and OS-enforced isolation (ContentSandbox host))
- [artifact] NAT.14: real, delivered outcome of NAT.14 (Pdf family: PDFium and production parser containment in the WP11 helper (NEW library))
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: 
Unblocks: NAT.30, PLT.46

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Local real-integration run of the affected scenario in an existing environment, recorded once; offline and static checks in CI; no hosted runtime, device, browser, live-service or inference CI (P2-017).

Execute ArcForges delivery task PLT.56 — Three professional products compose the shared DesignSystem/Shell without divergence.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\platform.md (anchor task-plt-56).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: integration/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: that ArcNotes, ArcScope and ArcSlate each restore only the shell packages/mechanisms they need, feel like one family (shared tokens/commands/settings/attention/error presentation), and that no product had to depend on another to render its own UI (BR-02 of WP10).

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-10.90 (the multi-product consumption evidence beyond a single clean package-only diagnostic): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\10-design-system-and-desktop-shell.md, anchor rule-wp-10.90

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.platform is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] PLT.35: real, delivered outcome of PLT.35 (Publish DesignSystem/Shell packages and verify real integration)
- [artifact] NOTES.03: real, delivered outcome of NOTES.03 (Editor interaction: caret, selection, IME composition, markdown-friendly input)
- [artifact] SCOPE.09: real, delivered outcome of SCOPE.09 (Long-running capture in the shell)
- [artifact] SLATE.22: real, delivered outcome of SLATE.22 (Viewer: source and sequence, professional transport)
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Execute ArcForges delivery task PLT.57 — End-to-end capability invocation with real security enforcement inside one product.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\platform.md (anchor task-plt-57).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: integration/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: that the WP-09.07 invocation pipeline's 'authorize' step, wired to the real WP-11.02 decision pipeline, actually gates a real product capability end to end (resolve -> availability -> freeze -> authorize -> invoke -> validate -> record -> audit), closing the IAuthorizer interface seam both PLT.24 and PLT.38 are built against.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-09.07 (real authorize-step integration): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\09-capability-contribution-and-resource-model.md, anchor rule-wp-09.07
- WP-11.02 (real invocation-pipeline attachment): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\11-security-foundation.md, anchor rule-wp-11.02

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.platform is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] PLT.24: real, delivered outcome of PLT.24 (Invocation pipeline)
- [artifact] PLT.38: real, delivered outcome of PLT.38 (Decision pipeline and the four enforcement points)
- [artifact] APP.01: real, delivered outcome of APP.01 (Assistant.Abstractions host ports and application identity)
