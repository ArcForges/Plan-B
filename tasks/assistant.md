# ArcForges delivery task prompts — Embedded assistant

Generated from Design `docs/planning/delivery/delivery-graph.json` by `tools/delivery.py`; do not edit by hand.
Each block is self-contained. Claim a task only when `python tools/delivery.py ready --claims` lists it,
then follow `arcforges-implementation.md`. Tasks are ordered by lane for reading; the order is not a schedule.

Execute ArcForges delivery task AST.01 — Single application history store (model 05 schema).

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\assistant.md (anchor task-ast-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Assistant.Persistence.Sqlite implements the full data-model-05 schema (assistant_conversation/branch/message/draft/turn/receipt/outbox/history_import/attachment/project/conversation_project/profile/skill/context/task_projection/compaction), migrations and typed payloads, plus Android logical-schema fixtures. Competing model-02 conversation tables retired.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-15.00 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\15-arcchat-conversation-core.md, anchor rule-wp-15.00

Entry condition: ADOPT.02 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] APP.01: published Assistant.Abstractions product/profile identity
- [contract] CON.91: published Foundation contract types (identity/error/revision)
- [contract] CON.11: complete generated package/schema gate output
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Assistant.Core/**; DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Assistant.Persistence.Sqlite/**; DesktopPlatform:tests/AssistantCoreTests/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-assistant-store-schema (append): Numbered migrations are allocated at merge by the integration owner (a rebase renumbers pending migrations); each migration is forward-only with its recovery and downgrade-refusal tests; no task edits a merged migration.; RES-desktopplatform-build-config (append): Solution/project lists, central package versions and CI job lists are appended by the task that adds a project, dependency or job; dependency additions follow the dependency-admission policy with a reviewed receipt; lock files are regenerated after rebase and never hand-merged; the integration owner resolves ordering conflicts at merge.
Unblocks: AST.02, AST.03, AST.04, AST.05, AST.06, AST.07, AST.08, AST.09, AST.22

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit tests: DDL with foreign keys, migrations, disk-full, branch fork, concurrent-window stale revision, duplicate terminal frame, interrupted send; no live environment.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Schema/migration hash, transaction-kill and disk-full test results, one-store-per-application-profile proof.
Notes: Foundation for all other WP15 substeps and for WP16/17's reuse of conversation identities; a schema mistake here invalidates branches, attachments, projects, skills, search and export simultaneously, so it should land and stabilize early.
