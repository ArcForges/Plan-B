# ArcForges delivery task prompts — Release readiness and family release

Generated from Design `docs/planning/delivery/delivery-graph.json` by `tools/delivery.py`; do not edit by hand.
Each block is self-contained. Claim a task only when `python tools/delivery.py ready` lists it and no claim branch exists,
then follow `arcforges-implementation.md`. Tasks are ordered by lane for reading; the order is not a schedule.

## Release readiness and family release

Execute ArcForges delivery task REL.01 — ArcNotes desktop release readiness.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\release.md (anchor task-rel-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcNotes (integration owner: ArcNotes integration owner).
Kind/size: release/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: ArcNotes' desktop release candidate passes the complete update matrix on all three platforms against a candidate/staging feed, and carries a complete licence/SBOM/provenance/NOTICE record for REL.07 to roll up.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-50.02 (ArcNotes' own complete update matrix (fresh install, upgrade, two-version upgrade, downgrade protection, rollback, interrupted download, interrupted install, corrupted-artifact rejection, update during a long task, update with documents open, uninstall preserving user data, channel switch both ways, blocked bad version) on Windows/macOS/Linux): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\50-full-platform-production-release.md, anchor rule-wp-50.02
- WP-50.01 (ArcNotes' own licence inventory, SBOM, provenance attestation and verified NOTICE): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\50-full-platform-production-release.md, anchor rule-wp-50.01

Entry condition: ADOPT.04 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [release] NOTES.32: ArcNotes feature-complete release candidate
- [artifact] UPD.08: the published ArcForges.Update package/client (the platform lane UPD area)
- [release] NOTES.14: ArcNotes document core accepted
- [release] NOTES.22: ArcNotes search and portability accepted
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- [integration] REL.10: production feed/signing cutover pointing at this proven candidate

Permitted write scope: ArcNotes:eng/release/**; Design:docs/assurance/wp50-02-arcnotes-*.md
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-production-release-trust (append): Changed only by release tasks, once per promoted candidate; test-signed feeds and fixture roots stay separate from production.
Permitted substitutes (never real integration evidence): SUB-desktop-candidate-feed: the update matrix (fresh install/upgrade/rollback/etc.) works against a correctly-shaped feed Real producer ['UPD.07']; removed by REL.10
Unblocks: REL.07, REL.10, REL.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Local opt-in runtime observation per platform under P2-017/ci-and-local-validation-policy.md; no macOS CI - an independently produced macOS installer has its own local build/signing evidence; Windows/Linux installers promote their original CI-produced candidates, never rebuilt.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Full update-matrix results table per platform; licence/SBOM/provenance/NOTICE closure report for the ArcNotes artifact.
Notes: Analogous tasks exist for ArcScope (REL.02) and ArcSlate (REL.03); all three can run in parallel once their own product WP and WP53 are ready.

Execute ArcForges delivery task REL.07 — Contracts/SDK release audit (licence, SBOM, provenance rollup).

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\release.md (anchor task-rel-07).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Contracts (integration owner: Contracts integration owner).
Kind/size: acceptance/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Every shipped artifact across every surface has a licence inventory, SBOM, provenance attestation and verified NOTICE, and every reused item has a completed provenance record, rolled into one closure report.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-50.01 (the audit mechanism (licence inventory, SBOM, provenance attestation, NOTICE-generation verification per artifact, copied-content audit) plus Contracts/public-SDK's own candidate audit and the cross-artifact provenance-completeness rollup): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\50-full-platform-production-release.md, anchor rule-wp-50.01

Entry condition: ADOPT.03 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):

Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: Contracts:eng/release-audit/**; Design:docs/assurance/wp50-01-audit-*.md
Unblocks: REL.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline document/metadata rollup; no new build or download beyond what each surface already produced, per P2-017.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Closure report per artifact; NOTICE verification; provenance-completeness check across every recorded reuse.
Notes: Distributed-responsibility pattern: each surface task produces its OWN artifact's evidence as part of its own completion (WP50.01's per-artifact language); REL.07 owns the audit mechanism and the cross-artifact completeness rollup, mirroring GOV.13's role for PG-11/invariant accounting.

- none

Permitted write scope: Cloud:eng/release/commercial/**; Design:docs/assurance/wp50-05-commercial-*.md
Unblocks: REL.07, REL.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Full commercial gate evidence set from WP42; configuration assertion on the regional route; a received payout is required, not merely a successful test transaction, per BR-05.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Commercial gate evidence set including the received payout; regional-route configuration assertion.
Notes: VG-10/VG-11/VG-12 (supplier onboarding, payout eligibility, regional enablement) are WP42's own gates (a09), consumed here rather than produced.

Kind/size: release/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A game-day exercise across the full severity ladder runs against the real deployed production topology with recorded evidence for every go-live gate; every alert maps to a rehearsed runbook, on-call is in place, and support/enforcement/appeal paths are operable.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-50.04 (the game-day exercise across the severity ladder against the real production topology only (the rest of 50.04 is REL.06)): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\50-full-platform-production-release.md, anchor rule-wp-50.04
- WP-50.07 (full: alerting live and mapped to rehearsed runbooks, on-call arrangement in place, incident process exercised, support entry points live, enforcement/appeal paths operable, advisory process rehearsed): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\50-full-platform-production-release.md, anchor rule-wp-50.07

Entry condition: ADOPT.07 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):

- [release] OPS.12: rehearsed runbooks and PG-04 closure (the commerce, policy and operations lanes OPS area)
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: Cloud:eng/release/game-day/**; Design:docs/assurance/wp50-04-gameday-*.md, wp50-07-operational-readiness-*.md
Unblocks: REL.06, REL.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): A real exercise across the severity ladder against real production topology; alert-to-runbook completeness assertion; on-call verification; support-path end-to-end test; local/opt-in per P2-017, no synthetic-only substitution.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Game-day record with per-gate go-live evidence; alert-to-runbook, on-call and support-path results.
Notes: Named explicitly in the assignment as its own bucket ('combined disaster drill'); folds WP50.07 in alongside WP50.04's game-day portion since both are evidence of the same severity-ladder incident-response exercise.

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Blocked-bad-version refusal test against both feed and compatibility policy; no rebuild - promotes the exact already-proven candidate per BR-01; per P2-017 local/opt-in observation only.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Feed population record; signed-installer listing consistency; blocked-bad-version refusal evidence.
Notes: Production feed hosting and signing-key invocation follow the updater lane design; key custody is the Release Engineering Owner.

Execute ArcForges delivery task REL.11 — Family release readiness audit and honest statement.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\release.md (anchor task-rel-11).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: release/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Every gate in release-gates.md is evaluated for every surface with a named, resolvable evidence artifact; every still-open gate's blocking consequence is stated; no cross-system failure row in architecture/20-cross-system-lifecycles.md lacks a run test; every public claim is backed by gate evidence, iOS is explicitly stated as outside current scope, and nothing incomplete is presented as complete.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-50.00 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\50-full-platform-production-release.md, anchor rule-wp-50.00
- WP-50.08 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\50-full-platform-production-release.md, anchor rule-wp-50.08
- WP-50.90 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\50-full-platform-production-release.md, anchor rule-wp-50.90

Entry condition: ADOPT.02 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [release] REL.01: ArcNotes desktop release readiness complete
- [release] REL.02: ArcScope desktop release readiness complete
- [release] REL.03: ArcSlate desktop release readiness complete
- [release] REL.04: Android release readiness complete
- [release] REL.05: Web outputs release readiness complete
- [release] REL.06: Cloud/AI production readiness complete
- [release] REL.07: Contracts/SDK release audit complete
- [release] REL.08: commercial activation complete
- [release] REL.09: combined disaster drill and operational readiness confirmed
- [release] REL.10: production feed/signing switch complete
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: Design:docs/assurance/wp50-00-readiness-audit.md, wp50-08-honest-statement.md, wp50-stage-acceptance.md/.json; DesktopPlatform:eng/release/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-design-evidence (append): Receipts and gate records are separate files per task or gate; indexes are appended; historical records are not rewritten.

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Gate-coverage report asserting no gate is unevaluated; evidence-resolution check asserting every claimed evidence artifact exists; cross-system failure-row coverage check; claim audit comparing every required feature and owner WP to real gate receipts and public claims; per P2-017 no new runtime beyond what each surface already produced.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Gate-coverage report; claim audit; WP50 stage-acceptance receipt joining REL.01-10.
Notes: Terminal task for the entire 51-package sequence (WP50 has no downstream). BR-01/BR-02/BR-03/BR-04 (build once, no partial pass, no waiving integrity/security/licence/regulatory gates, nothing incomplete presented as complete) all bind here directly.
