# ArcForges delivery task prompts — Android companion

Generated from Design `docs/planning/delivery/delivery-graph.json` by `tools/delivery.py`; do not edit by hand.
Each block is self-contained. Claim a task only when `python tools/delivery.py ready --claims` lists it,
then follow `arcforges-implementation.md`. Tasks are ordered by lane for reading; the order is not a schedule.

Execute ArcForges delivery task AND.01 — Android production identity and stable toolchain reconciliation.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\android.md (anchor task-and-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Mobile (integration owner: Mobile integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: com.arcforges.mobile applicationId/namespace/source packages adopted, and a mutually compatible stable JDK21/AGP/Kotlin/Compose/Gradle tuple is pinned with wrapper checksums, version-catalog locks and generated-client compatibility evidence.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-30.00 (all work except the parts mapped to AND.04): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\30-mobile-shared-architecture.md, anchor rule-wp-30.00
- WP-30:3-binding-rules-apache-2-0-boundary-no-g §3 binding rules: Apache-2.0 boundary, no GPL-family implementation, immutable producer artifacts (package-level obligation contribution): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\30-mobile-shared-architecture.md, package-level obligation

Entry condition: ADOPT.10 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] PRF.10: immutable toolchain compatibility manifest (exact AGP/Kotlin/Compose/Gradle versions proven together on a real release build)
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: Mobile:app/build.gradle.kts; Mobile:app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml; Mobile:app/src/main/kotlin/**; Mobile:gradle/libs.versions.toml; Mobile:gradle/locks/**; Mobile:gradle/verification-metadata.xml; Mobile:gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties; Mobile:eng/policy/**; Mobile:eng/provenance/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-mobile-build-config (append): The module skeleton task registers all modules once; later tasks edit only their module; catalog entries are appended and locks regenerated after rebase; dependency additions carry admission receipts.
Unblocks: AND.02, AND.04

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Windows/Linux full build, dependency-verification metadata check, package/certificate inspection under P2-017; device install and App Link fixture-key tests are local opt-in, not CI gates
Completion evidence for the ledger: Exact pinned tuple + wrapper checksums + regenerated locks; F-023 re-run showing closure holds after the identity change
Notes: Must also decide the KMP shared/ preview module's fate: arch-27's module map (core/*, feature/*) has no KMP target, so shared/ stays a dev-only convenience outside the shipped app graph, never a second production plan (per WP30 §4).

Unblocks: AND.03, AND.04, AND.05

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Architecture/import boundary tests (no React Native/iOS/AGPL imports, no cross-module leakage) as offline static checks; targeted offline unit tests per module
Completion evidence for the ledger: Module dependency graph report showing one-way core<-feature<-app dependencies; route ID inventory matching AN01-AN25
```

Execute ArcForges delivery task AND.03 — Android runtime and OS adapters (Compose, Credential Manager, Keystore wrapper, WorkManager, FCM registration, SAF/MediaStore).

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\android.md (anchor task-and-03).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Mobile (integration owner: Mobile integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: arm64 release / x64 emulator adapters for Compose, Credential Manager/passkey fallback, Keystore, WorkManager, FCM with non-GMS fallback, and SAF/MediaStore/FileProvider exist in core/security, core/data and core/network, with no unsafe fallback path.

Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: Mobile:core/security/**; Mobile:core/data/**; Mobile:core/network/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-mobile-build-config (append): The module skeleton task registers all modules once; later tasks edit only their module; catalog entries are appended and locks regenerated after rebase; dependency additions carry admission receipts.
Unblocks: AND.06, AND.07

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Targeted offline unit tests for adapter contracts; install-on-real-device, permission-refusal, process-death and missing-Play-services scenarios are local opt-in under P2-017, not CI
Completion evidence for the ledger: Adapter test matrix (permission refusal, process death, missing Play services, callback after account switch) with device identity recorded for local runs
Notes: Can proceed in parallel with AND.04 (core/network gRPC client) and AND.05 (Room, core/data) once AND.02's skeleton lands; they touch different files within shared modules so should be sequenced as short-lived parallel PRs, not serialized.

Permitted write scope: Mobile:core/network/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-mobile-build-config (append): The module skeleton task registers all modules once; later tasks edit only their module; catalog entries are appended and locks regenerated after rebase; dependency additions carry admission receipts.
Unblocks: AND.07

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Targeted offline codec/adapter unit tests; real device/service calls against a deployed Cloud host are local opt-in evidence, not a CI gate (matches CloudHelloClient's existing pattern)
Completion evidence for the ledger: Real packaged Maven consumer + service/device call evidence with exact hashes/versions/device identity
Notes: Merged duplicate integration or closure task formerly proposed as CON.97.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Mobile (integration owner: Mobile integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Room schemas (local_schema, scope_partition, projection, draft, outbox, transfer, cursor, preferences) implement per-profile partitions with a durable, bounded, never-silently-evicted outbox; local canonical history is not evictable cache.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-30.04 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\30-mobile-shared-architecture.md, anchor rule-wp-30.04

Unblocks: AND.07

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline Room migration/instrumented-on-emulator-or-device tests for crash recovery, capacity refusal and atomic outbox writes; local opt-in for real-device runs under P2-017
Completion evidence for the ledger: Migration test results; outbox capacity-refusal and awaitingReconciliation replay tests; no silent eviction of draft/outbox rows
Notes: Fully local; remote Task/AI content reconciled through this store may use named fixtures until WP31/52 per the producer matrix ("Task/AI fixture allowed only until 31+52"), but the store/journal/outbox mechanics themselves must be real now.

Completion evidence for the ledger: Full account/attention path walkthrough against real Cloud endpoints
Notes: Does not need WP26 (remote bridge), WP45 (push sender) or WP52 (Harness) to start or complete — only WP30's own foundation and the already-deployed WP22/23. Demonstrates that not all Android features wait on the complete Harness.

- WP-31.04 (physical receipt closure): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\31-arcchat-mobile-android.md, anchor rule-wp-31.04
- WP-32:pg-24-completion-gate-paragraph-recheck PG-24 completion-gate paragraph (recheck on distributed artifact) (PG-24 closure): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\32-mobile-release-and-store-gates.md, package-level obligation
- WP-45.09 (device-delivery half): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, anchor rule-wp-45.09
- WP-32.05 (physical/no-GMS/permission evidence half): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\32-mobile-release-and-store-gates.md, anchor rule-wp-32.05

Entry condition: ADOPT.10 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] AND.12: real, delivered outcome of AND.12 (Presence, push, links and settings (AN20-AN24))
- [artifact] AND.23: real, delivered outcome of AND.23 (Distribution acceptance)
- [artifact] OPS.10: real, delivered outcome of OPS.10 (Customer push delivery and registration lifecycle)
- [artifact] AND.21: real, delivered outcome of AND.21 (Physical device and recovery gates)
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: 
Unblocks: AND.12, AND.23, OPS.10, OPS.12

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Local real-integration run of the affected scenario in an existing environment, recorded once; offline and static checks in CI; no hosted runtime, device, browser, live-service or inference CI (P2-017).
Completion evidence for the ledger: PG-24: a project-bound FCM credential actually sends and a physical arm64 device actually receives, including duplicate/rotation/revocation and denied-permission/no-GMS recovery
Notes: Merged duplicate integration or closure task formerly proposed as COM.17.
