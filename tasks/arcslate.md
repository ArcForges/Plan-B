Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.01 — Exact time model: canonical ticks, rational rates, frame/sample time, half-open ranges.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: RationalRate, FrameTime, SampleTime, TimeRange and the 705,600,000 Hz tick domain exist with exact frame<->tick and sample<->tick round-trip on every supported rate, half-open range algebra (BO-01), and the five enumerated rounding sites (RP-02) as the only places a position rounds; a policy test asserts no other code path rounds.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.01 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.01

Entry condition: ADOPT.06 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- none
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Domain/Time/**; ArcSlate:tests/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Tests.Unit/Time/**
Unblocks: SLATE.02, SLATE.03, SLATE.06, SLATE.14, SLATE.17, SLATE.20, SLATE.29, SLATE.38

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit tests only: NTSC/audio/negative/source-inexact/ties-even/half-open/overflow vectors per WP-36.01; no runtime/device dependency; AOT-compatible pure C#.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Per-rate round-trip table (frame->tick->frame, sample->tick->sample), long-sequence drift measurement showing zero drift, boundary-sample fixture proving no duplicated/missing sample at a cut.
Notes: No cross-area start blocker: this is pure C# arithmetic against a frozen architecture-23 spec (§3, §3.10 OB-01..05) and the frozen slate.edit.v1/keyframe profile (26§4). It needs no persistence, no UI, no native ABI and no published Contracts wire type to begin. It is the least-blocked, most-parallelizable task in the whole area and should start immediately alongside repository bootstrap for the other lanes.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.02 — Project and sequence domain model.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-02).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Project (multi-sequence container) and Sequence (playable/renderable composition with its own SequenceSettings snapshot and output grids) exist as structurally distinct types over one shared MediaLibrary; Project != Sequence != media folder is asserted structurally.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.00 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.00

Entry condition: ADOPT.06 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] SLATE.01: RationalRate/TimeRange types for SequenceSettings video/audio output grids
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Domain/Project/**; ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Domain/Sequence/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-arcslate-build-config (append): Solution/project lists, central package versions and CI job lists are appended by the task that adds a project, dependency or job; dependency additions follow the dependency-admission policy with a reviewed receipt; lock files are regenerated after rebase and never hand-merged; the integration owner resolves ordering conflicts at merge.
Unblocks: SLATE.05, SLATE.06, SLATE.10

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit tests: multi-sequence-over-one-library assertion, project/sequence/folder distinction test.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Multi-sequence project fixture; structural-distinction test results.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.03 — Media asset/stream/metadata domain model and content-based relink algorithm.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-03).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: MediaAsset (stable logical identity, never a file path), MediaMetadata (streams/codecs/dimensions/rate/duration/colour/timecode/channel layout), MediaAvailability, and a relink algorithm that verifies asset identity/size/content-hash/metadata before reusing an origin hash all exist as pure domain types with no native type present.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.02 (domain types (MediaAsset/MediaStream/MediaMetadata/MediaAvailability) and the relink-by-content-hash algorithm; excludes the real native read/probe adapter): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.02

Entry condition: ADOPT.06 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] SLATE.01: source-stream time base rational types for MediaMetadata.rate/duration
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Domain/Media/**
Unblocks: SLATE.04, SLATE.05, SLATE.06, SLATE.21, SLATE.24, SLATE.36

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit tests: offline-open structure/edit-decision preservation, relink verification and mismatch reporting, per-device-location-one-logical-asset test, structural no-native-type test.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Offline-open fixture; relink match/mismatch vectors; multi-device-location-one-asset fixture.
Notes: Deliberately split from the native read adapter (SLATE.04): everything here is pure domain logic testable against synthetic MediaMetadata, matching WP-36.02's own text that WP-37 (full playback) is explicitly NOT an undeclared prerequisite for this step.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.04 — Native media metadata/probe read adapter (real import path).

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-04).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Importing a real media file populates MediaMetadata through the owned arc_media_probe ABI running behind the ContentSandbox boundary; malformed metadata and a child crash both preserve the native project (structure and edit decisions intact); content-origin is captured on import per the frozen carrier schema.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.02 (the real metadata/read adapter using the approved owned ABI and ContentSandbox, and the content-origin carrier/propagation/failure vectors recorded in this substep's evidence row): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.02
- WP-36:content-origin-carrier-propagation-failu Content-origin carrier/propagation/failure vectors (WP-36.02 required evidence addition; §8 additional completion requirement) (package-level obligation contribution): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, package-level obligation

Entry condition: ADOPT.06 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] NAT.07: published arc_media_probe / arc_media_reader_stream export in the ArcForges.Native.Media package (managed MediaProbe wrapper)
- [artifact] SLATE.03: MediaAsset/MediaMetadata domain types to populate
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- [integration] NAT.14: production ContentSandbox.Runtime.<rid> parser composition (hostile-media containment)

Permitted write scope: ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Infrastructure/Media/ProbeAdapter/**
Permitted substitutes (never real integration evidence): SUB-media-probe-fixture: domain/library/editing/timeline logic against synthetic but schema-conformant metadata only; never hostile-input containment or real decode fidelity Real producer ['NAT.07']; removed by SLATE.15
Unblocks: SLATE.05, SLATE.14, SLATE.15, SLATE.35, SLATE.36

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Local only; sacrificial-process/child-crash test requires the WP-13.13 sandbox on the existing environment; offline unit tests against the fixture substitute are the default CI path per P2-017 (no live hostile-parsing CI).
Completion evidence for the ledger: Malformed-metadata-preserves-project run; child-crash-preserves-project run; content-origin carrier/propagation/failure vectors with payload and manifest hashes (WP-36.02 required evidence addition).
```

Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.05 — Media library: bins, reference-in-place import, background analysis.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-05).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Bins organise assets; import defaults to reference-in-place and completes without waiting for background analysis/caches; an indexing failure never fails the import (the asset still exists, degraded and retryable).

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.03 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.03

Entry condition: ADOPT.06 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] SLATE.02: Project/MediaLibrary container
- [artifact] SLATE.03: MediaAsset identity
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- [integration] SLATE.04: real probe-populated metadata for a fully real import, as opposed to import against the SUB-media-probe-fixture

Permitted write scope: ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Domain/Media/Bin/**; ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Application/Import/**
Unblocks: SLATE.14, SLATE.35, SLATE.36

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit tests: import-completion-timing test, failed-indexing-still-imports test, large-library performance measurement (local, once).
Completion evidence for the ledger: Import timing results; indexing-failure-does-not-fail-import result.
```

Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.06 — Timeline structural model: tracks, items, clips, transitions, markers.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-06).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Role-typed Track, TimelineItem, Clip (in/out points referencing a MediaAsset, never a file path), Transition and Marker/RangeMarker exist; one asset supports unlimited independent clip instances; track ordering/enable/lock/solo exist.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.04 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.04

Entry condition: ADOPT.06 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] SLATE.02: Sequence to hold tracks
- [artifact] SLATE.03: MediaAsset reference type
- [artifact] SLATE.01: TimeRange for clip in/out and timeline placement
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Domain/Timeline/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-arcslate-build-config (append): Solution/project lists, central package versions and CI job lists are appended by the task that adds a project, dependency or job; dependency additions follow the dependency-admission policy with a reviewed receipt; lock files are regenerated after rebase and never hand-merged; the integration owner resolves ordering conflicts at merge.
Unblocks: SLATE.07, SLATE.10, SLATE.12, SLATE.18, SLATE.26, SLATE.29, SLATE.34, SLATE.38

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit tests: many-clips-one-asset independence, track operation coverage, structural no-file-path-in-clip test.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Many-clips-one-asset fixture; no-path structural test result.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.07 — Edit command pipeline and placement operations.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-07).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/XL. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: TimelineCommand infrastructure exists (expand link/group scope, validate locks/handles/overlaps/bounds, commit one undoable transaction, failure changes nothing, caller-supplied IDs replay identically) together with the placement-operation family, each exact per its declared semantics (e.g. Overwrite trims/splits only the target track interval; RippleDelete processes disjoint intervals latest-first so shift occurs once).

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.05 (the shared validate->expand-affected-set->one-transaction command pipeline, plus Insert/Overwrite/Move/Trim(in/out)/Split/Delete/Lift/RippleDelete/Extract/Duplicate exactly per slate.edit.v1 (26-product-behavior-profiles.md §4)): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.05

Entry condition: ADOPT.06 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] SLATE.06: Track/TimelineItem/Clip model to operate on
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Timeline/**; ArcSlate:src/ArcForges.ArcSlate.Application/Editing/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-arcslate-registries (append): Each feature registers its own commands and capabilities through its module; registry files are append-only.; RES-contracts-schema-sources (append): Each closure task edits only its own domain proto or HTTP-schema files and adds its own sharded constraint and fixture files; shared inventories (package inventory, foundation inventory, constraint aggregate) are append-only per closure. A proto file with several contributing tasks (operator, policy/configuration) has one designated author task and the others request changes through it. The integration owner merges closure pull requests one at a time and the next author rebases and regenerates.
Unblocks: SLATE.08, SLATE.09, SLATE.33

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit tests: independent operation examples, collision/source-handle tests, undo/restart vectors, per-command exactness on its own grid (video frame-precise, audio sample-precise, TG-03).
Completion evidence for the ledger: Per-operation exactness and non-destructiveness results; one-transaction-or-nothing failure vectors.
Notes: Sized XL deliberately: 10 commands sharing one pipeline is one coherent reviewable outcome (the pipeline's affected-set/validation/transaction contract), not ten unrelated features; splitting further would fragment review of the shared contract.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.08 — Relationship and retiming edit operations.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-08).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: The remaining TL-06 operations exist on the same command pipeline: Roll adjusts a shared cut with both source handles; Slide trims outer neighbours to keep the combined boundary fixed; Link!=shared-identity is enforced; RetimeCurve composes rationals and projects once at the decode boundary with a reported inexact mapping; Snap converts pointer tolerance to ticks once and previews before commit.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.05 (RippleTrim/Roll/Slip/Slide/Group-Ungroup/Link-Unlink/Enable-Disable/ReorderTracks/Transition(create-delete)/Snap/Retime+RetimeCurve/ripple-marker-scope exactly per slate.edit.v1): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.05

Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] SLATE.07: the shared command pipeline (validate/affected-set/transaction) and the placement operations these compose with (e.g. Roll needs two adjacent clips already placed)

Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.09 — Undo/redo stack and composite command grouping.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-09).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Every edit command produces one undo transaction; a complex multi-command user gesture groups into one composite undo step; undo is demonstrably a different mechanism from checkpoint and crash recovery.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.06 (undo/redo as a distinct mechanism from checkpoint/recovery: composite operation grouping, explicit commit-boundary (a transient drag/preview is never a committed command)): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.06

Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: ArcSlate.Infrastructure persists Project/Sequence/Timeline/MediaLibrary through the platform's single write path; fixtures/formats/arcslate/v1/ exists as the V1 project fixture; the storage schema version equals the highest applied migration.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Execute ArcForges delivery task SLATE.11 — Project checkpoints, crash recovery and project-version migration.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcslate.md (anchor task-slate-11).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A checkpoint is an explicit user action distinct from both undo and autosave; a kill mid-edit recovers to the last committed boundary and reports what was lost; a prior-version project migrates forward with semantic (not merely structural) preservation.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-36.06 (project checkpoints as an explicit user mechanism distinct from undo; crash recovery to the last committed boundary with explicit loss reporting; migration from prior project versions with semantic preservation): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\36-arcslate-project-and-timeline.md, anchor rule-wp-36.06

Outcome: ArcSlate.Media consumes the exact published ArcForges.Native.Media/.Colour/.Image/.Otio/.Graphics packages with managed input validation, safe handles and a sacrificial-process integration suite; sanitiser builds run in CI; every native dependency's licence position is recorded; no native type escapes the media layer.

Completion evidence for the ledger: ABI version-negotiation result; leak-free handle-lifetime proof; clean sanitiser run; sacrificial-process crash-containment result; PG-03 licence-position record.
Notes: First real ArcSlate-side exercise of the native P/Invoke boundary; WP-13.03 (Probe D) already proved decode+sync feasibility in isolation, but this task is where ArcSlate's own AOT-published, sanitiser-clean, sacrificial-process-tested consumption is proven for the first time. A failure here (ABI mismatch, handle leak, AOT trimming of a marshalled type) invalidates SLATE.16 through SLATE.31.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: The playback engine is driven by the timeline clock, decoupled from editing so an edit invalidates and re-requests incrementally without stalling playback; frames may drop but the audio/timeline clock stays correct; playback quality state (realtime/reduced/proxy/dropping/requires-render) is computed and visible.

Completion evidence for the ledger: Sync-under-load measurement; long-run drift measurement (must show zero); quality-state coverage matrix.
Notes: This is where WP-13.03's (Probe D) isolated decode+sync proof becomes a real, editable-while-playing product runtime under load -- the specific risk ND-04 in implementation-sequence.md names ('ArcSlate does not meet... synchronisation... problems for the first time at work package 36'). A narrow A/V-sync-under-load spike is worth running before building the full quality-state UI on top.

Outcome: Per-non-overlapping-track-cut sample ownership is assigned (never rounded) per BO-02, all track/transition contributions are summed once at each output index (BO-02/BO-03), filter/resampler padding primes DSP without being emitted independently, and gain/pan/dissolve/crossfade use the exact formulas of 26§5 (10^(dB/20) gain, equal-power pan/crossfade).

Notes: The design doc devotes a full worked example (23-simulator-and-interchange.md §3.4) to exactly the boundary-duplication defect this task must avoid (directional outward rounding on both sides of a cut double-emits the boundary sample). This is a subtle, easy-to-get-wrong correctness area that also anchors PG-20; worth a narrow proof against the TV-08 fixture before building the full mixing/gain-staging UI on top.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/XL. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Render runs as a native Product Job (progress, pause, resume, cancellation) owned and recovered by ArcSlate, never entering task.task or consuming AI capacity; output writes to a temporary target and commits atomically so a crash/cancel/missing marker never exposes a complete-looking file; a long render survives machine sleep and resumes where the platform permits.

Outcome: SubtitleTrack/SubtitleCue exist as an independent track role (never a text-overlay effect); imported millisecond timestamps convert exactly to ticks; export rounds each endpoint once to nearest millisecond (ties-to-even) and reports maximum endpoint error and any collapsed-cue extension/refusal; exported files carry the content-origin carrier/sidecar.

Outcome: A local isolated ProductJob freezes the selected sequence revision/range, extracts mono PCM16 WAV in <=30s/1MiB chunks, and records exact sample counts/hashes/conform mapping without auto-uploading; adoption previews derived segments as authored subtitle cues, binds NativeContentRev, requires explicit partial-output acceptance where applicable, and commits one undoable edit carrying AI content-origin.

Notes: This is the REAL landing point for WP-26 (Application Presence and One-Application Tool Bridge), not WP-36. WP-36's header lists 07/10/13/26 as upstream, but nothing in WP-36.00-36.07's actual scope (project/timeline/media domain model) touches remote application presence or the tool bridge; WP-26's substeps (ApplicationService, ToolRequest queue, owner reauthorization, remote approval) are about exposing an already-running desktop instance to Cloud-driven remote invocation, which is exactly WP-39.00's capability-surface scope.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcSlate (integration owner: ArcSlate integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Importing a real.otio file (through the pinned official library, behind the narrow C ABI, no adapters/plug-ins/executable content) decodes each finite double via its exact binary rational, normalises only within one ULP of a declared standard rate, stages the result with a fidelity report the user reviews or cancels, and never silently drops timeline structure.

Completion evidence for the ledger: Per-vector numeric-boundary results; no-silent-frame-shift proof; malicious-path-denied and malformed-input-rejected-before-commit results.
Notes: OB-01..OB-05's exact-binary-rational-decode-then-normalise-only-within-one-ULP rule is intricate and gates PG-15/PG-20/PG-03 simultaneously. A narrow numeric-adapter proof (the finite/NaN/overflow/ULP vectors alone, before building the full staged-import/fidelity-report UI) is worth doing first, since a wrong approach here invalidates broad downstream evidence, matching the same class of risk the design doc's own worked example (23-simulator-and-interchange.md §3.10) calls out.
