# ArcForges delivery task prompts — ArcScope

Generated from Design `docs/planning/delivery/delivery-graph.json` by `tools/delivery.py`; do not edit by hand.
Each block is self-contained. Claim a task only when `python tools/delivery.py ready` lists it and no claim branch exists,
then follow `arcforges-implementation.md`. Tasks are ordered by lane for reading; the order is not a schedule.

## ArcScope

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.01 — DataSource/SourceAdapter contract, connection profiles and lease/busy exclusivity.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A single adapter contract (DataSource/SourceAdapter/Connection) exists with persisted, reusable connection profiles; editing a profile never rewrites a historical session's recorded configuration; a second claimant on the same source is refused with a busy state.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.00 (shared adapter contract; ConnectionProfile storage/reuse; EffectiveConfigurationSnapshot immutability on profile edit; lease/busy exclusivity model (BR-01..BR-06, BR-09)): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.00

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] PLT.01: published store abstraction with the single write path (for ArcScope's own profile/session store)
- [contract] CON.91: published Contracts records for capture/session identifiers referenced by ConnectionProfile
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/**; ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Adapters/Contract/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Adapters/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-arcscope-migrations (append): Numbered migrations are allocated at merge by the integration owner (a rebase renumbers pending migrations); each migration is forward-only with its recovery and downgrade-refusal tests; no task edits a merged migration.
Unblocks: SCOPE.03, SCOPE.04, SCOPE.05, SCOPE.08, SCOPE.11, SIM.06

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): offline unit/integration tests only (profile-edit immutability test, exclusivity test with two claimants); no live Cloud or hardware required at this stage
Completion evidence for the ledger: adapter-contract conformance tests, profile immutability test, exclusivity busy-state test
Notes: Foundational; SCOPE.03 (network/replay adapters) and SCOPE.04 (serial/USB adapters) both implement this contract and can proceed in parallel once it lands.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.02 — Channel, signal, event and time model.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-02).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A precise time model spanning signal samples and discrete events with exact rate representation, explicit conversion between domains, and explicit recorded alignment between sources.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.03 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.03

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [contract] CON.91: published numeric/time wire types (rate, timestamp, duration) Channel/Signal/EventRecord must serialise as
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/Time/**; ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/Channels/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/TimeModel/**
Unblocks: SCOPE.05, SCOPE.06, SCOPE.11, SCOPE.12, SCOPE.14

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): offline unit tests: precision across rate domains, alignment with two sources, conversion exactness — pure math, no external environment
Completion evidence for the ledger: precision/alignment/conversion test results
Notes: Pure domain/math task with no native or Cloud dependency; runs fully in parallel with SCOPE.01 (different files, same repo) — a clean simultaneous-execution example.
```

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.03 — Network and file-replay source adapters (TCP, UDP, file stream).

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-03).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: TCP, UDP and file-stream-replay adapters work over real transports (pure managed sockets/file I/O), pass connect/disconnect/reconnect tests, and share SCOPE.01's profile and exclusivity model.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.00 (TCP/UDP/file-replay concrete adapters over the shared contract; real-transport connect/disconnect/reconnect tests): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.00

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.01: DataSource/SourceAdapter contract and connection profile model
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Adapters/Network/**; ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Adapters/FileReplay/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Adapters/Network/**
Unblocks: SCOPE.05, SCOPE.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): real-transport tests using.NET Socket/TcpListener/UdpClient loopback and local files — no native dependency, no emulator/CI restriction applies; proportionate under P2-017
Completion evidence for the ledger: per-adapter real-transport connect/disconnect/reconnect results
Notes: This is the implementation-sequence.md §3 'must be real early' item: real serial/TCP/UDP transports must not be mocked.
```

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.04 — Serial and USB instrument adapters.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-04).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Serial and USB adapters work over real hardware transports via the native ArcInstruments ABI, enumerate/open/transfer/cancel correctly, refuse busy/permission conflicts per Tier-1 RID, and record a hot-unplug as an explicit capture gap.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.00 (serial/USB concrete adapters over the shared contract): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.00
- WP-33.90 (generic-USB-V1 body text (enumeration, explicit interface/endpoint open, control/bulk/interrupt transfers, partial writes, cancellation, driver/permission/busy refusal per Tier 1 RID; no automatic kernel-driver detach; hot unplug records an explicit capture gap) — this text sits orphaned between WP-33 §6 and §7 in the source doc with no substep id of its own; folded here since it is entirely about the serial/USB adapter, not §33.90's own verify-and-integration content): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.90
- WP-33:orphaned-generic-usb-is-v1-body-text-enu orphaned 'Generic USB is V1' body text (enumeration/open/transfer/cancel/refusal per Tier-1 RID, no auto kernel-driver detach, hot-unplug=explicit gap) sitting between §6 Impacts and §7 Tests with no substep id (package-level obligation contribution): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md — 

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.01: DataSource/SourceAdapter contract and connection profile model
- [artifact] NAT.13: published ArcInstrumentsNative package (arc_instruments_* ABI) — at minimum its fixture/simulated-hardware tier build
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Adapters/Instruments/**; ArcScope: src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Native/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Adapters/Instruments/**
Permitted substitutes (never real integration evidence): SUB-scope-instruments-fixture: adapter enumerate/open/transfer/cancel/error-path logic against a simulated-hardware build only Real producer ['NAT.13', 'NAT.24']; removed by SCOPE.11
Unblocks: SCOPE.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): fixture/simulated-hardware unit tests at this task's own gate; real per-RID hardware acceptance deferred to SCOPE.11/PG-08 per P2-017 (no device/hardware CI)
Completion evidence for the ledger: enumeration/open/transfer/cancel/refusal results against fixture tier now; real-hardware receipt at SCOPE.11
Notes: This is the one WP-33.00 sub-path that genuinely needs a WP13 native family, and only WP-13.12 (not the whole WP13 package). It is the correct place to attach PG-08's per-RID USB acceptance text, which the source document places oddly (orphaned paragraph after WP-33 §6, before §7) with no substep id.
```

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.05 — Acquisition pipeline: bounded loop, ring buffer, backpressure and overrun accounting.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-05).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A bounded, timestamped acquisition loop with explicit backpressure sustains throughput above the product target with bounded memory; every overrun is counted, timestamped and recorded; hardware timestamps are preserved where available and the timing source/uncertainty is recorded otherwise.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.01 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.01

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.01: source adapter contract
- [artifact] SCOPE.02: time/channel model
- [artifact] SCOPE.03: at least one real concrete adapter (network) to drive throughput/overrun tests
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Pipeline/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Throughput/**
Unblocks: SCOPE.06, SCOPE.11, SCOPE.13

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): sustained-throughput runs with recorded rate/memory/drop counts; induced overrun; timing-source assertions — local, offline, repeatable
Completion evidence for the ledger: throughput/memory/overrun/timing-source results
Notes: WP-13.02 ('Probe C: high-throughput acquisition', the native and runtime-proof lanes/WP13) is a near-identical early risk proof of the same ring-buffer/throughput/overrun approach, done earlier and cheaper. It validates the approach but ships no reusable package (BR-10 keeps the real loop in C# here regardless) — treated as an informative precedent, not a start edge.
```

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.06 — Session and capture lifecycle: segments, gaps and live observation.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-06).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: The session/capture lifecycle (armed, running, paused, stopped, finalised, interrupted) is correct; captures are sequences of segments plus explicit gaps; pausing the view never stops recording; a disconnect produces an explicit gap rather than a truncated capture.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.02 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.02

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.05: acquisition pipeline and rolling buffer
- [artifact] SCOPE.02: time/channel model
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/Session/**; ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/Capture/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Lifecycle/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-arcscope-migrations (append): Numbered migrations are allocated at merge by the integration owner (a rebase renumbers pending migrations); each migration is forward-only with its recovery and downgrade-refusal tests; no task edits a merged migration.
Unblocks: SCOPE.07, SCOPE.09, SCOPE.11, SCOPE.12, SCOPE.13, SCOPE.14, SCOPE.15, SCOPE.17, SCOPE.20, SCOPE.22

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): lifecycle coverage including interruption; pause-view-while-recording test; segment/gap integrity after disconnect — offline
Completion evidence for the ledger: lifecycle, pause-view and gap-integrity results
```

Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.07 — Durable capture writer, chunked verifiable store and crash recovery.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-07).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Raw capture is written to the chunked verifiable store with per-chunk checksums and an explicit end marker; a finalised capture is structurally immutable; a crash mid-capture recovers to the last committed boundary with an honest end marker and recorded loss.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.04 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.04

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.06: session/capture lifecycle types
- [artifact] PLT.06: published chunked/large-append verifiable store primitive
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Recording/**; ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Infrastructure/CaptureStore/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/DurableCapture/**
Unblocks: SCOPE.08, SCOPE.11, SCOPE.23, SCOPE.24, SCOPE.25

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): kill-during-capture at chunk boundaries and mid-chunk; recovered-prefix verification; immutability test — offline, deterministic fault injection, no live environment needed
Completion evidence for the ledger: crash-recovery prefix verification and immutability results
Notes: WP-07.05 is named precisely (not 'whole WP07') because WP-07.00/.03 (store abstraction, migrations) are consumed earlier by SCOPE.01/06 for ordinary relational state, while raw capture specifically needs the large-append/chunked primitive.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.08 — Replay as a source (capture-level).

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-08).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Replay of a recorded, finalised capture feeds the same pipeline as a labelled ReplaySource, always recording its origin, and never presents device-only fields as measured.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.05 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.05

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.07: durable, finalised captures to replay
- [artifact] SCOPE.01: source adapter contract
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Adapters/Replay/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Replay/**
Unblocks: SCOPE.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): replay-equivalence test against a recorded capture; labelling assertion; negative test for absent device-only fields
Completion evidence for the ledger: replay equivalence and labelling results
Notes: This is WP-34's repeatable source (SD-09): once this task lands, WP-34's reproducibility/analysis tasks can develop and verify against real recorded+replayed captures without any Cloud simulator.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.09 — Long-running capture in the shell.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-09).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/S. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Recording state is permanently visible; closing a window during capture always asks with consequences stated, never silently stopping or continuing; background capture persists only while genuine work is active.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.06 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.06

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.06: capture lifecycle (running/interrupted states) to bind the shell prompt to
- [artifact] PLT.32: published generic shell lifecycle/shutdown-prompt mechanism
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Presentation/**; ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Desktop/CaptureLifecycle/**
Unblocks: PLT.56, SCOPE.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): window-close-during-capture prompt test; background-residency test; visibility assertion — desktop-GUI-adjacent, kept to the offline/local tier per P2-017 (no desktop GUI CI; local manual/scripted verification)
Completion evidence for the ledger: window-close, background and visibility results
Notes: The old upstream edge WP-33<-26 (remote action/tool bridge) does not apply here or anywhere else in WP33: WP-26 is about remote-triggered tool execution on a running instance (durable target queue, owner reauth, remote approval), and none of WP-33.00-33.07's substep bodies mention it. See report 'inconsistent dependencies' section.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.10 — Reference drift check against Serial-Studio 639daafb.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-10).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/S. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A drift report exists comparing the reference against the bound commit, covering changed rows, newly introduced upstream material (mapped to an existing requirement or recorded as an accepted exclusion) and licence re-verification; every changed/new item carries a disposition.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-33.07 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md, anchor rule-wp-33.07

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- none
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: Design:docs/assurance/reference-coverage/arcscope-serial-studio.md
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-design-evidence (append): Receipts and gate records are separate files per task or gate; indexes are appended; historical records are not rewritten.
Unblocks: SCOPE.11

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): a completeness check that every changed/new item has a disposition; no code build required
Completion evidence for the ledger: drift report: changed rows, newly introduced material with assessment, licence comparison
Notes: Has no real code dependency on any other SCOPE task; can run at any time, though it is most useful shortly before SCOPE.11/WP-33.90 closes so any licence correction lands before the package gate.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.12 — Visualisation: virtualised rendering, downsampling, cursors and markers.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-12).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Time-series and event visualisation meets the responsiveness budget at corpus scale with virtualised rendering and downsampling; the display explicitly discloses when it is downsampled; cursor readings are exact regardless of display resolution.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Visualization/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Visualization/**
Unblocks: SCOPE.19

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): scale-corpus interaction measurements; downsampling-disclosure assertion; downsampled-vs-full-resolution cursor correctness — desktop rendering kept to local/offline tier per P2-017
Completion evidence for the ledger: responsiveness, disclosure and cursor-exactness results
Notes: RESOLVED FINDING, not an edge: the assignment hint suggested this might need the WP-13.14 Graphics native family (arc_graphics_* ABI). Checked 12-native-interop-and-media.md (the ArcScope native-interop authority, §8) directly: zero mentions of Graphics; its native surface is device/transport/high-rate acquisition primitives only. The Graphics native family's real consumer is ArcSlate (per the native and runtime-proof lanes' own contracts note: 'used by ArcSlate mainly'). ArcScope already carries Avalonia (Skia-based managed rendering, see ArcScope third-party/Avalonia.LICENSE.txt), which is sufficient for plotting/downsampling in pure C#.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A versioned decoder framework produces structured events (never raw channel data); malformed frames, checksum failures and unknown fields are surfaced with counts/locations; no decoder has a device-write path.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Notes: Independent of SCOPE.14 (measurements); the two can proceed in parallel. Decoder scope (UART/I2C/SPI) is fixed by the already-frozen analysis.v1 profile in architecture doc 26-product-behavior-profiles.md — note this is the ARCHITECTURE document numbered 26, unrelated to WP-26 (Remote action and tool bridge); no start edge needed since the design is already frozen, not missing.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Versioned analysis definitions compose into recipes; results are derived data reconstructable from evidence plus configuration; long analyses run as long-running product jobs with progress and cancellation; deleting and rebuilding all results matches the profile oracle within tolerance; historical results record their definition version.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-34.04 (full, including the required-design-implementation text: same profile through native ProductJobs over a frozen committed source; persist request/config hashes, resolved levels, per-family quality; delete-and-rebuild must match the profile oracle within tolerance): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\34-arcscope-analysis-and-reporting.md, anchor rule-wp-34.04

Completion evidence for the ledger: result reconstruction and version-recording results
Notes: 'Native ProductJobs' reads as ArcScope's own in-process long-running Task/CancellationToken job pattern ('under their product owner'), not a shared cross-repo service; DesktopPlatform already carries a BuildingBlocks ArcForges.Application.Abstractions package this can reuse. Not modelled as a hard external artifact edge — checked WP-08 specifically and ruled it out: WP-08 is local IPC/process registration, not a job-execution abstraction.

Outcome: Reports compose analyses, measurements, findings and visualisations into a portable exported form; every element traces to session, capture, time range, configuration snapshot, decoder version and analysis version; regenerating from recorded sources produces equivalent results.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-arcscope-format-fixtures (append): Fixtures are added per task under its own subdirectory; manifests are append-only.
Unblocks: SCOPE.26, SIM.06, SIM.09

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): bundle round-trip equivalence; precision-warning assertions; origin-recording test; fixture coverage for every claimed version — offline
Completion evidence for the ledger: bundle round-trip, precision warnings, origin and fixture coverage
Notes: This task also carries the bundle-side half of WP-51's 'simulator provenance separately' requirement — SIM.06 (ArcScope-side simulator ingestion) depends on this task so simulated captures round-trip through the same bundle format with their synthetic labelling intact.

Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.25 — Extension boundary: no third-party raw-capture write path.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-25).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/S. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: No extension-reachable path can write raw capture; extension access to ArcScope is through capabilities with owner-side validation only.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-35.05 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\35-arcscope-integration-and-sync.md, anchor rule-wp-35.05

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.20: capability surface
- [artifact] SCOPE.07: raw capture write path to assert exclusion against
- [artifact] EXT.02: published dual capability boundary mechanism
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.AssistantIntegration/ExtensionBoundary/**; ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/ExtensionBoundary/**
Unblocks: SCOPE.26

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): structural test asserting no extension-reachable raw-write path exists; owner-side refusal test from an extension caller — offline
Completion evidence for the ledger: extension no-write structural results

Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.26 — Owned-artifact verification and real integration.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-26).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner).
Kind/size: feature/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: The WP-35 candidate closes: metadata sync and explicit-upload behavior remain distinct; context/report data retain measurement identity and ownership across real service calls; PG-03 licence/provenance evidence recorded.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-35.90 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\35-arcscope-integration-and-sync.md, anchor rule-wp-35.90

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.20: all WP35 tasks complete to assemble
- [artifact] SCOPE.21: as above
- [artifact] SCOPE.22: as above
- [artifact] SCOPE.23: as above
- [artifact] SCOPE.24: as above
- [artifact] SCOPE.25: as above

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): metadata sync and explicit-upload behavior remain distinct; context/report data retain measurement identity across real service calls — real Cloud integration exercised here, not at earlier SCOPE tasks

Execute ArcForges delivery task SCOPE.27 — Real ArcScope metadata sync against the deployed Cloud sync engine.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\arcscope.md (anchor task-scope-27).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope (integration owner: ArcScope integration owner). Also touches: Cloud.
Kind/size: integration/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: ArcScope session and capture metadata sync scopes converge across devices against the deployed Cloud sync engine, replacing the contract-bound sync substitute; raw captures stay local unless explicitly uploaded.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-35.02 (real-integration evidence: metadata sync scope converges against deployed Cloud authority): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\35-arcscope-integration-and-sync.md, anchor rule-wp-35.02

Entry condition: ADOPT.05 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [artifact] SCOPE.22: ArcScope Cloud sync scope declaration and client
- [artifact] CLOUD.39: deployed guarded publication and convergent bootstrap
- [artifact] CLOUD.44: multi-device convergence harness
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: ArcScope:tests/ArcScope.Tests.Integration/Sync/**
Unblocks: SCOPE.22

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Local real-integration run against a deployed test environment, recorded once; offline checks in CI; no hosted live-service CI (P2-017).
Completion evidence for the ledger: Candidate identities, deployed environment identity, convergence scenario results and untested coverage.
Notes: Added during consolidation so the ArcScope sync substitute has a named replacing task.
