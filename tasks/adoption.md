# ArcForges delivery task prompts — Adoption stage

Generated from Design `docs/planning/delivery/delivery-graph.json` by `tools/delivery.py`; do not edit by hand.
Each block is self-contained. Claim a task only when `python tools/delivery.py ready` lists it, with
`python tools/delivery.py claim <TASK-ID> --worker <name>`, then follow `arcforges-implementation.md`.
Tasks are ordered by lane for reading; the order is not a schedule.

## Adoption stage

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task ADOPT.01 — Freeze the adoption baseline.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\adoption.md (anchor task-adopt-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B (integration owner: Plan integration owner, the holder of roles/integration-plan).
Claim and handoff record: claims/adopt-01 (python tools/delivery.py claim ADOPT.01 --worker <name>); task branch task/adopt-01 in Plan; ledger record ledger/tasks/adopt-01.md.
Kind/size: adoption/S. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: The Plan ledger records, for every repository, the main head, open pull requests and branches and the latest published candidate per registry, so every adoption slice starts from the same frozen inputs. The baseline is complete through WP-03.02; WP-03.03 has not started.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- P2-018 (adoption stage: baseline inputs): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\decisions\phase-2-specification-decisions.md, anchor rule-p2-018

Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- none
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: Plan:ledger/adoption/baseline.md; Plan:ledger/README.md

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Read-only inspection of repositories, pull requests and registry receipts already recorded; no builds, downloads or runtime checks (P2-017).
Completion evidence for the ledger: Baseline record with exact commit identities per repository, open pull request list and latest candidate identities; reviewed and merged in the Plan repository.
