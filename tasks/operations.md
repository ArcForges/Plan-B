Each block is self-contained. Claim a task only when `python tools/delivery.py ready --claims` lists it,
then follow `arcforges-implementation.md`. Tasks are ordered by lane for reading; the order is not a schedule.

## Operations, support and trust and safety

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task OPS.01 — Service levels and alerting.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\operations.md (anchor task-ops-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: service/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Service-level indicators measure user-visible success per capability group with realtime/managed-AI computed independently, error budgets are visible, and every deployed alert routes correctly and names an existing runbook.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-45.00 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, anchor rule-wp-45.00

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.07.operations is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- none
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: Cloud:deploy/monitoring/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-cloud-runbooks-and-fixtures (append): One file per runbook, monitor or provider fixture; indexes are append-only; recorded provider fixtures stay test-only.
Unblocks: OPS.02, OPS.04, OPS.12

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline tests: indicator correctness against synthetic failures, dependency-attribution, alert-routing, alert-to-runbook completeness assertion.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Alert-to-runbook completeness assertion (every deployed alert names an existing runbook).

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: service/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A shared four-severity ladder drives incident state tracked independently of production, a possible personal-data breach classifies automatically at the highest severity with the statutory notification clock as a hard deadline, and post-incident review produces runbook updates.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Execute ArcForges delivery task OPS.05 — Operator console and support access.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\operations.md (anchor task-ops-05).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Web (integration owner: Web integration owner).
Kind/size: service/XL. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: The operator console runs on a separate origin with a separate identity system, never in public navigation; support access is explicit, scoped, time-bounded, consented and audited; a destructive action needs a second authorised operator; and no parallel unversioned admin API exists.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-45.04 (all work except the parts mapped to OPS.13): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, anchor rule-wp-45.04
- WP-45:operator-contract-closure-the-real-conso Operator contract closure — the real console join (operator contract closure; the real console join — wiring every generated role/method pair into the console UI): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, package-level obligation
- WP-45:browser-matrix-acceptance-supported-degr browser matrix acceptance; supported/degraded/blocked browser behavior for the operator console's own flows (browser matrix acceptance; supported/degraded/blocked browser behavior for the operator console's own flows): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, package-level obligation

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.09.operations is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [contract] CON.14: the OperatorService full RPC surface
- [artifact] POL.05: the kill-switch RPC implementation
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- [integration] COM.13: the financial-owner RPC implementations

Permitted write scope: Web:apps/app/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-cloud-runbooks-and-fixtures (append): One file per runbook, monitor or provider fixture; indexes are append-only; recorded provider fixtures stay test-only.; RES-contracts-schema-sources (append): Each closure task edits only its own domain proto or HTTP-schema files and adds its own sharded constraint and fixture files; shared inventories (package inventory, foundation inventory, constraint aggregate) are append-only per closure. A proto file with several contributing tasks (operator, policy/configuration) has one designated author task and the others request changes through it. The integration owner merges closure pull requests one at a time and the next author rebases and regenerates.; RES-web-app-routing (append): The application shell task owns root route registration; each surface adds its own route module and per-origin edge directory.
Unblocks: CLOUD.64, OPS.06, OPS.07, OPS.08, OPS.11, OPS.13, WEB.31

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline/staged tests: silent-impersonation negative, scope/expiry, two-operator requirement, audit-completeness, parallel-admin-API-absence assertion, every generated role/method pair (allowed and refused), double-execution-of-one-approval negative; browser-support.v1 supported/degraded/blocked behavior per P2-017 (no live E2E browser matrix in routine CI).
Completion evidence for the ledger: Silent-impersonation negative result; two-operator requirement result; full role/method matrix exercised (allowed and refused).
Notes: BR-06 ('an operator never silently becomes a user') is a headline security invariant for the whole package; the silent-impersonation negative test is worth proving early against a minimal console skeleton before building every case-type UI on top.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud (integration owner: Cloud integration owner).
Kind/size: service/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Transactional/broadcast email use the real WP-22 Postmark/SES adapters with separated streams; outage and reconciliation drills are rehearsed under a prepared secondary path; and the private security-advisory intake-through-publication process is complete with in-product containment/revocation attention.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-45.08 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, anchor rule-wp-45.08
- WP-45:producer-prerequisites-wp45-08-must-cons Producer prerequisites (WP45.08 must consume real WP22 mail, no fixture) (producer prerequisites; consuming WP-22 real mail artifacts without deferring WP-22's own gate; package-level obligation contribution): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, package-level obligation

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.07.operations is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).

Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-cloud-runbooks-and-fixtures (append): One file per runbook, monitor or provider fixture; indexes are append-only; recorded provider fixtures stay test-only.
Unblocks: OPS.10, OPS.12

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline tests where possible (spoofed/replayed callback, bounced/complained suppression, content-redaction) plus recorded live-provider drill evidence (unknown send, DNS readiness, independent status/incident during a real Cloud outage) kept outside routine CI per P2-017.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Live operational evidence and rollback-contact record; signed advisory authenticity and affected-version-matching results; no disclosure before approved publication.
Notes: This task cannot use a mail substitute — WP-45 explicitly states runtime mail fixtures are absent and that WP-45.08 'is not the first email producer,' i.e. it must consume WP-22's real adapters from day one.

Kind/size: service/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Notification.IPushSender sends through a typed FCM HTTP v1 credential adapter with a unique delivery-intent outbox, generation/revocation checks and the exact push.v1 profile, working against an actual isolated Firebase project with bounded, fenced recovery.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-45.09 (all work except the parts mapped to AND.26): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, anchor rule-wp-45.09

Permitted write scope: Cloud:src/Cloud/ArcForges.Cloud.Modules.Notification/**/Push/**
Permitted substitutes (never real integration evidence): SUB-fcm-recorded-responses: Sender error, retry and token-invalidation handling only; live sending is proven by the same task and physical receipt by the Android integration task. Real producer ['OPS.10']; removed by AND.26
Unblocks: AND.26, OPS.12

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Live isolated Firebase project send (kept outside routine CI per P2-017, real service) plus offline tests for token-rotation race, crash-after-acceptance duplicates, TTL expiry, revoke-before-send, no-secret-logging.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Recorded invalid-token/payload/project/rate-limit responses; no-secret-logging scan.
Notes: Named as required-real-early scaffolding in implementation-sequence §3.1 (recorded FCM WP45.09 to WP32 proves device receipt) — unlike payment/mail, no fixture stands in for the server-side send itself; it is real against an isolated Firebase project from the start.

Execute ArcForges delivery task OPS.13 — Operator console exercises real financial-owner and kill-switch RPCs end to end.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\operations.md (anchor task-ops-13).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Web (integration owner: Web integration owner).
Kind/size: integration/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: an authorised operator can actually grant/revoke/issueCredit/adjustCredit/refund and activate a kill switch through the console UI, not just via direct RPC test calls

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-45.04 (exercise every generated role/method pair via the actual console UI): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, anchor rule-wp-45.04
- WP-45.10 (real operator console join): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md, anchor rule-wp-45.10

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.09.operations is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] COM.13: real, delivered outcome of COM.13 (Operator financial-owner proposal/approval operations)
- [artifact] POL.05: real, delivered outcome of POL.05 (Kill switches)
- [artifact] OPS.05: real, delivered outcome of OPS.05 (Operator console and support access)
- [artifact] CON.14: real, delivered outcome of CON.14 (Operator control service (OperatorService, full §9/9.1/9.2 protocol))
- [artifact] OPS.11: real, delivered outcome of OPS.11 (Package review and revocation console)
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: 
Unblocks: COM.13

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Local real-integration run of the affected scenario in an existing environment, recorded once; offline and static checks in CI; no hosted runtime, device, browser, live-service or inference CI (P2-017).
Completion evidence for the ledger: an authorised operator can actually grant/revoke/issueCredit/adjustCredit/refund and activate a kill switch through the console UI, not just via direct RPC test calls
Notes: Merged duplicate integration or closure task formerly proposed as CON.98.
