# ArcForges delivery task prompts — Foundation values

Generated from Design `docs/planning/delivery/delivery-graph.json` by `tools/delivery.py`; do not edit by hand.
Each block is self-contained. Claim a task only when `python tools/delivery.py ready` lists it and no claim branch exists,
then follow `arcforges-implementation.md`. Tasks are ordered by lane for reading; the order is not a schedule.

## Foundation values

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task FND.01 — Core identity and version-axis value-type skeleton.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\foundation.md (anchor task-fnd-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/S. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: ArcForges.Foundation exposes the UUID/revision/enum/error primitive types (registry-04 exact values) with generation and validation, adapting Contracts.Foundation wire types rather than redefining them.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-04.00 (all work except the parts mapped to FND.07): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\04-identity-error-and-versioning-primitives.md, anchor rule-wp-04.00

Entry condition: ADOPT.02 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [contract] CON.91: ArcForges.Contracts.Foundation package: canonical UUID/Decimal/Rational/exact-value wire types and codecs
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Foundation/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-desktopplatform-build-config (append): Solution/project lists, central package versions and CI job lists are appended by the task that adds a project, dependency or job; dependency additions follow the dependency-admission policy with a reviewed receipt; lock files are regenerated after rebase and never hand-merged; the integration owner resolves ordering conflicts at merge.
Unblocks: APP.01, FND.07, PLT.17, PLT.36, PLT.47, PRF.01, PRF.02, PRF.03

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): P2-017 scope: Windows/Linux build + offline unit tests, compile-negative tests for identifier/axis confusion, no macOS/hosted-runtime/device CI.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Compile-negative suite result for identifier and axis confusion; round-trip vectors for absent/default/unknown values.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/S. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A clock abstraction provides wall-clock Instant and MonotonicTimestamp as distinct types; storage is canonical (instant plus originating zone where meaningful), presentation is localised, durations always use monotonic time.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-04.03 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\04-identity-error-and-versioning-primitives.md, anchor rule-wp-04.03

Entry condition: ADOPT.02 (adoption of the owning repository) is complete in the Plan ledger.
Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- none
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Foundation/**
Unblocks: FND.07

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit tests: locale-change test asserting stored values unchanged, duration test asserting monotonic time used, DST boundary test for scheduled operations. Deterministic testing enabled by the clock abstraction itself.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A single generated reason-code registry (eng/policy/reason-codes.json, generated from source) exists with category, retryability, effect-certainty and message-key per code; Outcome<T> distinguishes success, typed failure and cancellation.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-04.04 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\04-identity-error-and-versioning-primitives.md, anchor rule-wp-04.04

Start prerequisites (each must be complete in the Plan ledger before claiming):
- [contract] CON.91: Contracts error/reason-code wire schema
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Foundation/**; DesktopPlatform:eng/policy/reason-codes.json
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-desktopplatform-policy-data (append): Generated policy data is regenerated from its pinned source and never hand-edited; the reason-code registry is append-only with stable codes; each task adds its own test classes and evidence rows.
Unblocks: FND.07, PLT.01, PLT.31, PLT.49, UPD.01, UPD.06

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Offline unit tests: registry completeness test, every failure path returns a registered code, cancellation never conflated with failure.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Reason-code registry with a completeness report.

Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: acceptance/S. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: ArcForges.Foundation and ArcForges.Application.Abstractions are packed, admitted to eng/packaging/packages.json, published from a main-branch candidate, and independently consumed to prove C#/TS round trips (values outside JS safe integers, absence/unknown values, duplicate commands, unknown effects) against Contracts' generated TS/Kotlin projections.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

- [artifact] FND.01: identity/exact-value types
- [artifact] FND.02: execution identity/idempotency types
- [artifact] FND.03: revision/sequence types
- [artifact] FND.04: clock abstraction
- [artifact] FND.05: reason-code registry

Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:eng/packaging/packages.json; DesktopPlatform:eng/version-sources.json
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-desktopplatform-build-config (append): Solution/project lists, central package versions and CI job lists are appended by the task that adds a project, dependency or job; dependency additions follow the dependency-admission policy with a reviewed receipt; lock files are regenerated after rebase and never hand-merged; the integration owner resolves ordering conflicts at merge.; RES-desktopplatform-package-inventory (append): Each producer task adds its own package entry; every merge to main packs and publishes all packages at one version; consumers pin the candidate produced by the merge of the capability they need, never waiting for a package closure task; one merge queue.

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): P2-017: pack once (whole-repo shared candidate version per the publish-nuget/pr-gate workflows), offline packages.py verify, no hosted runtime execution; cross-language vector tests run as local/offline unit tests against Contracts' committed fixtures, not live services.
Completion evidence for the ledger: Owned artifact and real-integration receipt: source commit, producer version, candidate hashes, real-versus-fixture status per the WP-04.90 template.
Notes: Merged duplicate integration or closure task formerly proposed as CON.93.
