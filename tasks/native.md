## Native producers and probes

```text
Execute ArcForges delivery task NAT.01 — Probe A: device tool execution under Native AOT.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\native.md (anchor task-nat-01).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Inside a published Native AOT desktop binary, a stub ToolRequest is pulled, re-authorised locally, resolved through the generated allowlist to a CapabilityKey, decoded into a typed product request, invoked and returns an idempotent result -- with an AOT publish log showing zero diagnostics and a negative test proving no reflection-based registration/decode path compiles or exists.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-13.00 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\13-high-risk-technical-probes.md, anchor rule-wp-13.00
- WP-13:ss1-nd-05-probe-scaffolds-13-00-13-03-ar SS1/ND-05: probe scaffolds (13.00-13.03) are cleanup-or-regression-fixture; production 13.05-13.16 code is retained and maintained -- different lifecycle rules for the two groups even though both may live under similar directories (package-level obligation contribution): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\13-high-risk-technical-probes.md, package-level obligation

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.native is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] PLT.18: generated CapabilityKey allowlist and static registration mechanism (Capabilities package)
- [artifact] PLT.09: local RPC structured-argument decode path (DP-02 boundary dispatch assembly)
- [artifact] PRF.04: a working pattern for AOT desktop <-> AOT desktop local RPC (from WP-06.01)
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:benchmarks/probes/agent-aot/**
Unblocks: APP.03, NAT.05, NAT.30

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): AOT publish log zero diagnostics; end-to-end ToolRequest->decode->typed invocation->result run inside the published binary; containment test confirming the structured value type appears only in the boundary dispatch assembly
Completion evidence for the ledger: AOT publish log and in-binary device tool request decode/execute trace; explicit note that the model loop itself is NOT probed here (it is the CF Workflow, LS-02/V-03)
Notes: One of WP13's four canonical early risk proofs (package goal: 'retire the four early technical risks'). Parallel with NAT.02/03/04 (disjoint write scopes).

Execute ArcForges delivery task NAT.02 — Probe B: block editor, store, undo and recovery.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\native.md (anchor task-nat-02).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A minimal block editor over the local store demonstrates create/edit/reorder, undo/redo across a composite operation, and recovery from a hard process kill mid-edit that returns to the last committed boundary with uncommitted work explicitly reported as loss -- proving undo, revision, checkpoint and journal are four distinct mechanisms.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-13.01 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\13-high-risk-technical-probes.md, anchor rule-wp-13.01

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.native is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Kill-during-edit recovery run; undo-across-composite-operation test; explicit test that undo history is not crash recovery (QI-09)
Completion evidence for the ledger: Kill-during-edit recovery and undo-distinction results
Notes: Parallel with NAT.01/03/04.

Execute ArcForges delivery task NAT.03 — Probe C: high-throughput acquisition over a real transport.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\native.md (anchor task-nat-03).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/M. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Sustained acquisition from a real transport (at least one real TCP/UDP/serial configuration, not an in-memory generator, per BR-06) runs above the intended product target through a ring buffer with responsive plot downsampling; overrun is counted and timestamped, pausing the view never stops recording, and disconnect leaves an explicit gap.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):
- WP-13.02 (full): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\13-high-risk-technical-probes.md, anchor rule-wp-13.02
- WP-13:ss1-nd-05-probe-scaffolds-13-00-13-03-ar SS1/ND-05: probe scaffolds (13.00-13.03) are cleanup-or-regression-fixture; production 13.05-13.16 code is retained and maintained -- different lifecycle rules for the two groups even though both may live under similar directories (package-level obligation contribution): C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\work-packages\13-high-risk-technical-probes.md, package-level obligation

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.native is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- none
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:benchmarks/probes/acquisition/**
Unblocks: NAT.05, NAT.30

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Sustained-throughput run with recorded rate/memory/drop counts; induced overrun; induced disconnect; pause-while-recording test
Completion evidence for the ledger: Sustained-throughput record with overrun/gap/pause results
Notes: No hard start-dependency on any other WP -- can begin immediately using a real TCP/UDP loopback or serial-over-USB pair; exotic hardware is not required for the first real-transport configuration. Parallel with NAT.01/02/04.

Execute ArcForges delivery task NAT.04 — Probe D: native decode and audio/video synchronisation.

Task record: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\lanes\native.md (anchor task-nat-04).
Delivery rules: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges-Design-B\docs\planning\delivery\README.md; execution: C:\MyFile\Projects\Plan-B\arcforges-implementation.md.
Owning repository: C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform (integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner).
Kind/size: producer/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: Native decode through a thin C ABI shim displays one frame in the desktop shell with audio/video synchronised against a shared timeline clock; safe handles, managed-side input validation, a clean sanitiser run and a sacrificial-process crash test all pass; hardware acceleration is discovered at runtime with a proven software fallback.

Obligations (authoritative definitions; satisfy exactly these parts and their tests/gates):

Entry condition: adoption slice ADOPT.02.native is complete in the Plan ledger (DLV-22).
Start prerequisites (before claiming, each contract/artifact/design prerequisite must be delivered or complete and each release prerequisite complete in the Plan ledger; DLV-24):
- [artifact] PRF.01: a shape for an AOT-published desktop shell capable of hosting a display surface
Completion prerequisites (may start earlier; cannot complete before these are complete):
- none

Permitted write scope: DesktopPlatform:benchmarks/probes/media/**
Shared resources (follow the owner protocol): RES-workstation-build-slot (append): One CPU-heavy local build or test at a time per workstation, coordinated by a lock file in the user profile; coding and review continue meanwhile; CI capacity is not limited by this rule.
Unblocks: NAT.05, NAT.30

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Frame-display run; audio/video sync measurement; sanitiser run (ASan/UBSan); sacrificial-process crash test; forced-software-path run
Completion evidence for the ledger: Frame display, synchronisation measurement, sanitiser and sacrificial-process results
Notes: GPU-accelerated path testing is necessarily per-local-machine (whatever GPU is available); the required CPU software-fallback path is universally testable. Parallel with NAT.01/02/03.

Kind/size: producer/L. Baseline: not-started.
Outcome: A new arcpdf-abi native library and ArcForges.Native.Pdf managed package implement arc_pdf_* over actual PDFium; PDFium and all approved parser wrappers are composed into the existing WP-11.09 ContentSandbox host using generated local gRPC controls (no second helper, no duplicate DTO owner); the next immutable ContentSandbox.Runtime.<rid> version is published; test-parser production registration is removed (hostile regression fixture retained).

Unblocks: NAT.25, NAT.30, NOTES.09, NOTES.37, PLT.45, PLT.54, SLATE.04, SLATE.16

Validation (P2-017; no macOS/hosted runtime, device, GUI, browser E2E, live-service, inference or installed-consumer CI): Packaged PDF page/text/tile fixtures, malformed/native-crash/hang and parent-death cleanup on every admitted RID; rerun of actual image/media/OTIO parser containment (not just PDF)
Completion evidence for the ledger: Actual PDF dependency and containment evidence contributing to PG-12; PG-22 runtime evidence for the real-parser leg (11.09 supplies the mechanism leg)
Notes: Highest residual security-relevant risk of the seven native families (hostile content inside a real isolation boundary) -- flagged as an early risk proof even though it is scheduled after NAT.06, unlike WP13's four canonical probes.
